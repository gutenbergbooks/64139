</div>

<p>The first I can recollect is, that I was very long lying in a box in
Soho bazaar, till one day I was taken down by one of the shopkeepers,
and shown to a very pretty little girl, about three years old, who,
after looking a whole case through, chose me. This little girl had
flaxen curls, and was dressed very prettily. Her name was Lucy
Fitzhenry. She wrapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
me up and carried me home to her house in the country, which was a
very pretty country-seat. Two or three days after she had me, her
nurse cut some very pretty clothes for me. My under-clothes were of
very fine linen, and my dresses of flowered muslin, blue merino, and
spotted calicoes. My mother was very careful of me; she washed me every
morning (for I was a porcelain Doll), and dressed me, and undressed me
at night. One day she took me into town to see the Queen and Prince
Albert, which I enjoyed very much indeed. As we were coming home
in the carriage, little Lucy let me drop out the window, upon some
burdock leaves, where I lay for some time. When I lay there, several
caterpillars came and crawled over me, and I thought that they were not
very pleasant company; however, I did not tell them so. After I had
lain there for about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
two or three hours, I was picked up by a little raspberry picker, who
was a German, named Johanna Worstel, who was over-joyed to find such a
beautiful doll, and went instantly to show her brother, Robertin, who
was also very glad. They then agreed to wrap me up in a cloth in which
they had brought their dinner, and there I lay until night and thought
over my past life; how my little mother Lucy had been so kind to me;
how she had taken me out, ducked me in a little stream, then dried me
in the sun, laughed with me, kissed me, and talked about my new mamma,
when suddenly a gust of wind took my cloak off, and I laid there very
cold. However, my mother came very soon and took me up. "Poor doll,"
said she, "how very cold she must be," and therefore she wrapped me up
in my dress very tightly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and then we went home. Their home was in a little building, (it was
once an out-house, but the house had been removed and it stood alone,)
where we had a very nice supper of water-cresses, bread and cheese.
After that I was covered over with some leaves, and there I went to
sleep.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="ph4">ELLEN GREEN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Early next morning my mother woke me up and carried me to the field.
After a while she spoke to her brother Robertin, and said,&mdash;"Roby,
don't you tink dat I had better go and give dis little dolly to Emma
Arthurst?" "Yes," said Robertin, "for don't you know how kind she was
to us." So off they started to give me to Emma, who was about five
years old. Little Emma was delighted and gave Johanna a half crown. My
mother, Emma, had another doll, whose name was Ellen Green, (by the
by, I never had any name till my new mother gave me one, which was
Josephine Arnoldson,) but I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
to this day she was a very naughty doll; for she always spilt her tea
on her dress, knocked down chairs, danced on the table, and I don't
know what else. One day my mother came and took me early from my nice
little bed, and dressed me in a beautiful frock of white muslin, with
a pink sash, and violets and other flowers in my sash. I had seen my
mother working on something for some time, and now I knew what it
was. My mother then told me that it was May-day, and that I was to
go to a May party; but she said that Ellen should not go because she
had behaved so naughty. At first I was glad to hear this, but after a
while I felt differently and begged my mother to let her go. Whether my
mother could not withstand my pleading, or had determined to try Ellen
once more, I don't know, but she at last consented to take Ellen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
My mother was dressed in white, and so were a great many other little
girls. We enjoyed ourselves very much, but at last Ellen began to
behave badly. She tore a hole in her dress, and at last she acted so
badly, that my mother had to put her in the hollow trunk of a tree
where we left her. Then we all went into a clump of most beautiful
pine trees, and eat our dinner there. After that we played round, and
then went home, not without taking Ellen with us. I had stayed with my
present mother about six months when I was taken sick, the account of
which I will defer to my next.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="ph4">MY SICKNESS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One night as I was lying in my bed, my head began to swim, my lips
were parched, and I felt very sick. After passing the night in great
distress, my mother came to me and said, "Dear little Josey, how sick
you look!" and so she did not take me up. By and by the little girl
who played the most with Emma came in and said, "Why, Emma, you have
not taken your doll up this morning." "No," said Emma, "she is very
sick, and so I did not think it best to take her up." "Well," said the
other little girl, "I will be a doctor, and you must send for me to
come and attend your doll." So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Emma sent, and the little girl came and ordered me some pills and a
powder, which I was to take. They made the pills out of bread and the
powder out of slate-pencil dust. I took these and they quieted my pain
some, but still I was very sick. The next morning the doctor came and
ordered me something else, which I took, as in duty bound, although I
must say it did not taste very good. After two or three weeks I began
to get a little better, and then Ellen came and saw me; but she began
to talk in her old way about my having new dresses, and she having to
take mine, (for she and I were of the same size,) and her having to
stay in the trunk while I enjoyed myself, and then she ended by saying
that she was glad I was sick, for now she could have her own way, as
she had before I came. I found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> out
afterwards that my mother had been telling Ellen about me, and saying
that I was a pink of perfection, and that she ought to pattern by me.
So Ellen hated me heartily, which I was very sorry for, as I had a sort
of liking for her, although she did behave so badly. One evening after
tea, Emma having left the room, her father said, "Wife, I think that
as Emma is old enough to help us, that she had better begin next week
about the dairy and help you. She will have to dispense with her dolls,
and I think she had better give her prettiest doll to her cousin, who,
I dare say, will like it." When Emma came in, her father told her his
intentions, and how she had better give the handsomest doll to her
cousin Celeste. Emma cried very much at leaving her doll, and so did I,
but she thought it better to do so.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="ph4">EMMA'S COUSIN&mdash;MY NEXT MAMMA.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Next day Emma dressed herself very neatly, and rode over to her
cousin's, which was about five miles from her father's house. Emma
cried all the way, and I, in spite of myself, could not help crying
too. At last we arrived at a very splendid mansion-house, where Emma's
cousin lived. Her aunt was very glad to have Emma come, and Celeste
was very much pleased with her doll, although she said she was almost
too old to have a doll. By and by Emma went home, and I was left in
the hands of my new mamma. She then called her brother, Maximilian
Belmont, to see her doll, which he thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
was very pretty indeed. My last mother had told me that her aunt was
a "baroness," and her uncle a "baron," which I was very glad to hear,
as I thought I should see some very high life. The next day my new
mother went out with her governess to buy some things for me, and as
they could not buy any thing fit for me in the country, they went into
town. They went to the very same place where I was first bought by my
first mamma, Lucy, and bought me a swinging bed, with mattress, and all
complete; also a tea-set, bureau, piano, a set of parlor furniture, and
a most beautiful bracelet, necklace, ring, and a pair of ear-rings. We
next drove to a jeweller's, and had my ears pierced, and the bracelet
was marked "Josephine Arnoldson." I forgot to say that my mother bought
me a most beautiful little house that I could live in, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
had it carpeted, papered, painted and furnished. The next day my
mother's governess cut out some dresses for me. I had morning dresses,
afternoon, visiting, riding, party and ball dresses. My party and
ball dresses were so very handsome indeed, that I think I must let my
readers know what I had. My party dress was a pink silk, looped up in
front, showing a white satin skirt embroidered up and down with flowers
over the silk. My ball dress was a white satin with white crape over
it, and small bouquets down the front, white kid gloves, an embroidered
handkerchief, white silk stockings, and white satin slippers. Also a
most beautiful wreath of orange flowers and forget-me-nots for my hair,
for I had real hair which curled.</p>

<span class="ph4">GARDENING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One day I observed my mother put on her things very slily, call her
governess and tell her to put on her things also, and come out. I
thought to myself, "What can this mean? My mother has put on her
clothes, called the footman and ordered the carriage, and has taken her
governess with her." I guess it is something that I am not to know; for
if it were not, I certainly would have gone with her. As I did not feel
very well, I thought that I would lie down on my bed and take a nap. In
a couple of hours my mother came home, and coming into the room where
my baby-house was, took me out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
bed, without saying a word to me about her having been out. I burned
all the time to know what she had been out for. I could hardly eat my
dinner, and when tea came I could eat nothing. The next day, at twelve,
a man rang at the hall-door, and my mother ran down to let him in, a
thing that she had never done before, and which made me so curious that
I could not stand. In a few minutes my mother came running up stairs,
and put a little bundle into my hands. I opened it very quickly, and
what did I see but a little hoe, rake, spade and wheelbarrow! I thought
that I could never thank my mother enough. When she saw how pleased I
was, she told me that I should have a piece of ground, and she would
get me some seeds, and she would also immediately make me a gardening
dress, so that I could commence the next day. Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
how I longed for the morrow to come, and when the morning dawned I was
almost crazy. My mother put on my dress, and giving me my tools took me
into the garden, where I took my first lesson in gardening. I thought
it was delightful. My mother told me that I should soon get along
very fast, and that I should plant some flower and vegetable seeds. I
felt very smart, and began to work away quite industriously, making
improvement in the looks of my garden. When my mother appeared and told
me breakfast was ready, I could hardly believe it, the time had passed
so quickly. The next morning my mother waked me at half past five, and
dressing me took me out. As we were going along to the garden we saw by
the road-side a flock of geese, and as we passed along they set up a
tremendous hissing. Oh, how frightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
I was; but my mother laughed at my fears, and told me not to be afraid,
as they would not hurt me. When I got to the garden, I was all of a
tremble, and for five minutes I could not do any thing. I got the
garden all finished that morning before breakfast, and so I went in,
and changing my dress went out to take a walk. As I went along the
paths, I could not help feeling overcome. It was a beautiful spring
morning, the dew was on the grass, and the birds were singing their
morning song of praise to the Maker of all things, as they soared
towards heaven. When my breakfast bell rang, I came in and told my
mother of my pleasant walk, and she seemed very glad. The next morning
my mother showed me how to plant seeds, after which she watered them,
as she said the watering-pot was too large for me, but that she was
going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
to buy me one, so that I could water my plants when they came up. In a
day or two my mother, her governess and I went into the city and bought
me a little watering pot, and a little book that treated of gardening,
which I put with my other books. One morning, about two weeks after
planting my seeds, I was surprised to see several little green things
which I thought were weeds, and I was just going to pull them up, when
I happened to think that perhaps they might not be weeds after all, and
that I would stop and ask my mother. My mother appearing up the gravel
walks just then, I asked her what they were, and she told me that they
were the plants just beginning to come up, and that I must water them
every morning carefully, and soon they would come up higher and higher;
then the leaves would come out, and at last little buds would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
shoot forth and turn into flowers. But in order to have them do so, I
must keep all the weeds away from them, water them morning and evening,
and put up sticks for the running ones.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="ph4">BLACKBERRYING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>At six the next morning we both got up (that is, my mother and I), and
began dressing ourselves. "Stop, Josephine," said she, "don't put on
that dress, as you are not going out into the garden this morning."
"Why not," said I, but I began to take off my dress. "Because," said
my mother, "Geraldine Norton has invited me to a blackberrying, and
you are to go." "Oh mother, I am so glad that I don't know what to
do with myself; but what dress am I to wear?" "Oh, wear your purple
calico." In half an hour we were dressed, had our breakfast eaten, and
were ready to go. I was so impatient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
be off, that I thought that we should never go. Pretty soon Celeste (my
mother) said she saw them coming; and sure enough there they were, a
whole troop of boys and girls, with their pails and baskets. Celeste
took me up in her arms and ran with me down the carriage-way, not
without having brought her pail and mine. We next called for a dozen
more girls and boys at their houses. At eight o'clock we had got about
a couple of miles from the place. Antoinette Leland suddenly screamed
out, "Here he comes, here he comes!" "What comes?" cried they all. "The
bull, the bull," said Antoinette, and sure enough there was a monstrous
large bull coming in double quick time right behind them. Such a
scampering! Pell-mell went the whole troop to escape the pursuer. At
last we saw a little cave not very far off, and all made a rush for that
,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
when my mother screamed out to George Glover, "Throw off that red
scarf, George, or else the bull will gore you to death. Look, see
how he foams and how madly he paws the ground!" The scarf was off in
an instant, and the bull rushing upon it, began tearing it into a
thousand pieces. When he was doing this, we had time to get out of his
sight before he made another attempt to attack us. We soon got to the
berrying place, and then we began to pick and talk in earnest. The
theme of the conversation was about the bull, and how nicely they got
away from him. George Glover made a wreath of leaves and presented it
to Celeste, telling her that she was his guardian angel. Celeste gave
him a box on the ear, but they both laughed heartily. In a few moments
they heard screams, and beheld one of the girls rolling down the hill,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
all her berries spilt. One of the boys, however, stopped her, and all
joined in filling her basket again. At noon we all had dinner, (each
of the party bringing something,) under a group of trees. The dinner
was an excellent one. We brought clear cool water from the spring,
and squeezed berries into it; we had meats and every thing that we
could want to make a gipsy dinner. One of the boys, Charles Hammond,
to improve the repast, took a jews-harp out of his pocket, and played
several tunes, beginning with "God save the Queen," and ending with
an air from "Linda di Chamounix." His performance was loudly cheered.
Bella Barker, one of the gayest of the girls, then got up and made
a speech, which was also clapped and cheered. The dinner was then
finished, and we went to pick some more berries to make up for the ones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
we had eaten. On our way home, my mother and all the rest stopped to
pick wild flowers, when Lorgnette Edwards ran forward to gather a
little blue and white flower which was a little before her. Suddenly
she began to scream, and running to the place where she stood, we
found ourselves in no very pleasant situation, as we had got upon a
marshy place, and were over our shoes in mud and water. We all began
scrambling out as fast as we could, and turned our faces the other way.
We went to a little spring that we saw, and taking off our shoes and
stockings, gave them a washing out, for we said that we preferred to
have wet stockings and shoes on our feet to muddy ones. After going a
little way we saw a wild cherry tree, up which the boys soon scrambled,
and threw down the fruit into our aprons. We got home about six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
o'clock, having been gone eleven hours. I felt very tired, and was glad
to have my supper, and get into bed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="ph4">BALLS, PARTIES, &amp;c.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>About a week after my dresses were made, my mother said that we were
going to the opera that night, and the opera was going to be "Robert
le Diable." Oh! how glad I was; I almost went out my wits for joy, for
now I knew that I should see some most splendid things. I was dressed
in a blue silk, with an opera cloak and hood; my mother was dressed
so also. At last we came to the opera. Oh, how my heart beat! After
sitting a little while, the musicians began to play. Oh! such music; I
felt as if I never wanted to go home, but wanted to stay there all my
life. My mother then told me to hark and try to hear a little bell that
would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
ring very soon. I listened, and in a minute I heard it ring, and then
ring again, and then the curtain was pulled up. The most beautiful
singing that ever I heard was sung that night. I felt as if I was above
the clouds, and listening to angels instead of mortals. By and by the
curtain came down, and then my mother told me that was the end of the
opera, but there was to be a ballet soon. I now had an opportunity
to look round the house. The place was immense, and was filled with
people. I never saw so many before in all my life, and I never could
have believed that so many persons could be got into one place. Pretty
soon we had the ballet, and if I was pleased with the singing I was
still more so with the dancing. The ballet was "La Sylphide," and
Taglioni took the principal part. We got home about one o'clock, and
I laid till ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the next morning, I was so sleepy. In a couple of weeks my mother
took me to the Earl of Egmont's ball, where we had a most superb
supper. There were about six hundred persons there, and I passed a
most delightful night. I got home at twelve o'clock. I thanked my
mother next morning for all her kindness to me, and she told me in the
future that I should accompany her to all the balls she went to. So
I went to a great many balls and parties, to which I owe my present
polished manners. Even in the midst of their gaiety I had not forgotten
my mother Emma Arthurst, and my sister Ellen, and was on the point
of asking my present mother to let me go and see them, when she came
running into the room and said, "Dear Josey, here is a letter for you
from your last mother Emma." It ran thus:&mdash;</p>

Your sister Ellen still continued the same bad girl, and so I sent

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="ph4">THE SEASHORE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>My mother Celeste once took me down to Ramsgate, thinking, as she
said, that I needed sea-bathing. She packed her clothes and mine, and
ordered my house (the baby-house) to be carried behind her. The next
morning my mother rode in her carriage, which was made expressly for
herself and me, to the water-side, where we went into a little house,
and putting on our bathing clothes, jumped into the water. My mother
had fastened me by a string to her waist, and so could swim without
being troubled by me. She then showed me how to keep myself above water
and how to swim, for she said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
soon she was going to let me bathe alone. I enjoyed the water very
much, and thought what a great loss it must be to some dolls, who
cannot go into the water because their complexion will not allow them
to be washed in any thing but sweet oil or butter. I thought how sticky
it must feel during the process, and how uncomfortable it must be
afterwards. We went into the little house again, after bathing, and put
on our skirts and dresses. All day it was very hot, and we remained in
the house reading, until evening, when we went to bathe again. While
bathing, I saw several large birds fly over the water, and several
times dip down into the waves. I asked my mother what they were, and
she said they were sea-gulls.</p>

<p>The next morning, when we were in the midst of bathing, there was the
cry of "A shark! a shark!" As soon as this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
was said, every one started for the shore, and all got there safely,
except one little girl, about nine years of age, who was so frightened
that she could not swim. The shark was nearing to her every moment. At
last a strong and brave man jumped into the water, and swimming up to
the shark, killed him with a long knife which he carried in his belt.
After a couple of weeks spent in this manner, we went home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="ph4">AN ACCIDENT.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In about a month I had a terrible accident, which I am about to relate.
One summer afternoon, as I was looking out the window, I fell out of it
into a winding stream, where I lay floating down I don't know where. I
was so stunned by the fall that I fainted, and did not recover myself
till I had floated some miles. When I recovered, I found that I was
in the hands of some fishermen, (they were not regular fishermen, but
only angling for sport,) who examined me very attentively. At last one
said, "I'm sure I don't know what to do with this little doll." "Oh!"
said the other one, "there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
goes a little milk-maid, let's give it to her." "So I say," said the
first. "Here little girl, don't you want a doll? if you do, here is
one." "Thank you, Sir," said my new mother, whose name was Agnes
Earl, "I'm very much obliged to you." So Agnes took me home. She was
a very pretty little girl. She had black eyes, black hair, and a dark
complexion. I passed a very pleasant life with my new mother. She used
often to talk to me in a very motherly way; such as this: "My dear
Josephine, I am very glad to see you behave so well, and I am very
sorry that I cannot bring you into better society than I can. However,
I think that we had better not worry about it, as you are almost
polished enough." My mother used to talk to me in this way of evenings,
and I hope I profited by some of her lectures to me on goodness. My
mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
used often to give me baths, to which I think I owe my good health. One
afternoon, after my mother had bathed me, as was her usual custom, and
had laid me in the sun to dry, two little girls came along and picked
me up.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="ph4">QUARRELSOME MOTHERS.</span></h2>

</div>
<p>"Holloa! here's a doll, I'll have it," said the biggest girl, whose
name was Martha Griggs.</p>

<p>"No you won't, either, so there you told a lie," said Madge Griggs.</p>

<p>"I'm the oldest, and ought to have it," screamed Martha.</p>

<p>"And I'm the youngest, and the oldest ought to give up to the smallest
one," said Madge.</p>

<p>"You shan't, you shan't, you impudent jade, so you may just clear out
of the way," yelled Martha, striking her sister with all her might.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! oh! oh! how you have hurt me! I shall tell mother of you as soon
as we get home," said Madge.</p>

<p>"I don't care if you do, Miss," said Martha.</p>

<p>Then they went home, Martha with the doll, and Madge following behind
her all the way. I thought that I was very unfortunate in the change
of my mammas, for, thought I, I can't pass a very pleasant time with
these quarrelsome mammas, and I'm afraid that I may have my legs or
arms, or even my head broken in a fray, which I should not like very
much. At last we came to the house where they lived, and then we had
supper, and I was put to bed. I cried very much that night, for I was
sad at leaving my little mother Agnes, and I felt bad at having such
quarrelsome mothers as I now had. I never could get a moment's peace,
for if one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
my mothers wanted me put to bed, the other one wanted me to get up. I
can remember one day what a quarrel occurred, and these were the words,
as nearly as I can recollect. "Madge, where's my doll?" "It's not your
doll." "That's a lie." "It aint, I'll have that doll." "You won't, I
found it in the grass." "I'm the youngest and ought to have it. Father
says you ought to give up to the youngest." "Will you tell me where
that doll is, for I want to put its apron on?" "Ah, ha, you won't get
it now, if you want to put its apron on, for I am going to put its
worst dress on, so as to let it slabber in the dirt." "No you won't,
either," and Martha gave Madge slap after slap, and slap after slap,
till I thought that Madge would never see light again. That night when
I went to bed, I thought how much better it would have been for Martha
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
have kindly asked Madge for me, and for Madge to have answered kindly;
and I hope that all my readers will never imitate Madge and Martha.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="ph4">THE SNOW-MEN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The next day after the quarrel, my mother said that the children,
during recess at school, were going to make a "snow-man," and that they
would take me to school with them. At twelve they had their recess,
when Martha, not finding her scarf as usual, laid the loss of it to
Madge, and said, "You, Madge, what have you done with my scarf? bring
it here." "I have not done any thing with it," said Madge. "You lie,"
was the coarse and unladylike retort. At last Martha found her scarf,
hanging on her nail, with her cloak over it. When we got into the yard,
my mothers brushed away the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
snow from off a little place on the steps, and set me down there
to see the making of the snow-man. The manner of making it was
thus:&mdash;They each took a small snow-ball and rolled it in the snow,
over and over, and then they joined all together and made one large
ball. They then took a stick and made a couple of holes in the ball for
eyes, and made a straight mark, rather deep, for his mouth, and then
took a piece of snow and made it into a nose, as well as they could,
and fastened it on. Then they made another ball considerably larger
than the first, for his body, and put his head upon it. Legs and arms
were also fastened upon the body. When this was done, they all gave
three cheers, and went into the school-room.</p>

<p>When my mother got home, they thought that they would try and make a
snow-man, such as the boys had made in the school-yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>They had got the head made, and were looking after a stick with which
to make the eyes and mouth, when down came the head upon Madge,
knocking her down to the ground, and covering her up with snow. As soon
as she had extricated herself, she let loose her tongue, and another
scene and storm of words followed after their usual manner. Such
frequent disputes as these made me regret more and more my previous
home, and long to make some change, which I thought must certainly be
for the better; but the time had not yet come.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="ph4">THE THEATRE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The next week the children's teacher said that he would take them to
the "Theatre," for they had behaved so well! I thought differently.</p>

<p>There was nothing talked of but the "Theatre" from morning till night;
and I am sorry to say that this was a subject of dispute too. One said
they would get the first bill and have theirs read through first, and
the other was going to hear the bell jingle first, and sit in the front
seat; one was going to be looked at the most, and be dressed first; and
the other was going to get into the carriage first, and get the best
seat, and so on. The day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
at length arrived. I felt happy, too, though there was such dispute,
for I remembered when I went to the "Opera" with my late mother,
Celeste Belmont, and how I enjoyed myself. The children were in high
spirits, and kept incessantly talking of what a nice time they would
have if they were only there now. I longed to tell them to have a
little patience, but I was afraid I should get my neck broke if I did
so. At length the maid arrived to dress them, and in their hurry to
get up stairs before each other, Madge tumbled down stairs, but did
not hurt herself much. Such dressing, why you would almost think their
clothes flew off, as did their buttons, in their hurry to get dressed
before each other. Martha got dressed first, and then she went for
me. I was in a pink muslin, with blue roses in my hair, and my mother
thought I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
looked splendidly. We lived out of town, and had to ride into the city,
so we had a very nice ride. We went to the "Covent Garden Theatre."
It is a splendid place, but not so pretty as the "Royal Italian Opera
House," where I went with my mother, Celeste Belmont. There was some
scrambling to get the front seat between Madge and Martha, but at last
it was settled. We sat in a stage box, which was beautiful. The play
began. There was once a beautiful young girl, and she had two lovers;
she liked one, and the other she didn't like; and there were meetings,
and tumbling-down places, and all that sort of thing. At last this
pretty young girl married the lover she liked, and the other lover went
away, when I tumbled on to the stage in a bouquet which they threw,
though they did not know that they had thrown me.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="ph4">MY STAGE EXPERIENCE</span>.</h2>
</div>

<p>I was now in the hands of a pretty little "<i>danseuse</i>," who ran with me
into the "green-room," saying, "Oh! mother, see this beautiful Dolly,
that was thrown to me in a bouquet; isn't it pretty?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said her mother, "it is very pretty, but hadn't you better put
it down, and go and dance the "Craccovienne," which you have got to
dance?" "Certainly, mother, as soon as I have got my heels on." I found
out soon afterwards that it was her dancing heels. My new mother's name
was Caroline Eldgrave. We soon went home to a very nice house, where we
boarded. That night how thankful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
I was that I had got away from Madge and Martha, for now I felt I
should enjoy myself very much; and besides that, I should see behind
the scenes, and be in the dressing-room, which I had often wished for.
The next day my mother took me to the rehearsal, and when she began to
dance, she put me beside one of the wings, so that I might learn to
dance. We lived out in the country, about ten miles south of my late
mother's house, in a very neat cottage. My new mother taught me a great
many fancy dances, among which were "La Cachuca," "La Craccovienne,"
"La Smolenska," "Highland Fling," and a great many "hornpipes,"
besides quadrilles, polkas, waltzes, and the Mazurka, Redowa, and
Schottische. My mother was to dance and act in a new pantomime, which
was called "The Elements and Fairies;" and <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> which she was determined
to have me act in. So she asked the manager if he could not have me do
something in it. The manager consented, and when my mother told me, oh!
how happy I felt. My mother took me to the rehearsal every day with
her, and made me a dress. It was of white gauze, over white satin,
with gold spangles, and a gold paper crown on my head. Of course I had
little silver shoes and fleshings. I was to represent the Fairy's guard
in the clouds, and to appear in a sun. I at first felt rather giddy
when I mounted the pedal behind the sun, but I soon got accustomed to
it. I appeared to a lover in a dream. I did not feel degraded, and I
hope my readers will not think less of me.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="ph4">THE PANTOMIME.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The evening arrived. We drove into town rather earlier than usual.
My mother let me peep through a little slit in the curtain to see if
the house was full. The play commenced, and was as follows: First,
there came a most beautiful fairy, and said, "Elements, I beg your
aid; come forward! and be not afraid." Immediately a water-fall that
was pouring over some rocks divided, and a most beautiful fairy came
out, and said, "Queen, I come at thy command, what would'st thou
have?" "Be patient, spirit." Then the Fairy of Air appeared, and said,
"Queen, what would'st thou?" "Be patient."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Then the Fairy of Earth came right out of the floor, and said, "O
Queen, I come at thy call." "Be patient." Then the Spirit of Fire came
forth out of a rock with a loud hissing noise, and said "What would ye
have me do? I'll burn down houses and land, nor deal with a partial
hand." "Stop," said the Queen, "none of this! Instead of hurting,
I want you all to befriend, a poor young man, who goes to get the
talismanic wand, which will put him in possession of the most beautiful
princess in the world. Therefore I request that you shall aid him."
Then they all answered, "Whatever is thy will, we do." The next scene
was a wood, where this young man passes through, and is attacked by
demons, snakes, bears, and all sorts of bad things. At length he goes
to sleep, and I appear to him in a sun, and hold a scroll, which
 <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
says on it, "Persevere! the fairies, thy guardians, are ever near."
Then the scene changes to a demon's place of resort. Here all is
fire and demons, with square faces, and some with hump-backs and
goggle-eyes, claws, wings, and tails. The king then said, "Ye devils of
lower regions, come forward!" And instantly a whole troop of devils, of
all shapes and sizes, came forward. He then told them that he wanted
them to exert themselves, and try to keep that young man from getting
the wand, so that he could not get the princess. Then one of the devils
said that he would go and misguide him; and so he dressed up as a
handsome young man, and went and met this man that was going to get the
wand, and said, "Friend, where goest thou?" "I go to seek the wand."
"You do! why then you have got the wrong path." "I have! why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
'twas only a minute ago that an old man said that I had
the right path, if I went to seek the wand." "Do not believe him; he
lies; that is the way which lies open before. Take that path there.
Adieu!" The young man that was to seek the wand, said, "How lucky that
I met that man; for if I had not I should have gone the wrong way, and
missed the princess for ever." Then there was a clashing sound, and I
appeared in the sun, and held another scroll, which said, "That young
man is a demon disguised, and has led you into the wrong path. Take
this ball and throw it before you, and wherever it rolls, you follow."
I threw him down a ball. He then followed the ball, and disappeared.
The next scene was, where the "Fairies" were, and they sung splendidly.
Presently the Queen came through the air, riding in a chariot, drawn
by peacocks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
She said, "Listen, Fairies." Then the fairies said, "We
will." The Queen said, "The young man will soon reach the palace where
the wand is kept. I wish you to help him across the 'Golden Lake.' Now
disperse." Then all the fairies disappeared. The next scene was, where
the demons were, again; and the demons screamed horribly, and the King
came through the air, in a coach, drawn by serpents, and said, "Hark,
Demons;" and the demons said, "We will." The King said, "The young
man, who will soon be at the palace in spite of our endeavors, is to
cross the 'Golden Lake;' and I wish you to do all in your power to
prevent him from getting the wand. Now go;" and all the devils went.
The next scene was the palace, where the wand was kept, and the young
man got the wand in spite of all the devils and bats, owls, serpents,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
dragons, and ghosts. As soon as he had got the wand in his hands, the
devils all uttered a scream, and went through the floor, and a chariot
came through the air with the "Princess," (who was my mother) and the
"Fairy Queen." The scene changed to a most beautiful garden, with the
palace of the sun at the back, and the sun over it, and I in it. All
the performers were on the stage at once, and danced a "Fancy Dance."
This ended the pantomime, or rather spectacle, for nearly all spoke.
After the performance, a little girl came in the dressing-room, and her
father and mother. My mother saw that she cast longing eyes at me, and
so she stepped up, and said, "Will you be so kind as to accept of this
Doll?" The little girl said she would.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="ph4">MY NEXT MOTHER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>We then drove home. My mother's name was Garafelina Shoppard. They
were a very vulgar, purse-proud, stuck-up people. My little mother was
all the time talking to me about money, and making a show. We went
to a party one night. My mother's mother, (my <i>grandmother</i>) did not
know how to dress in good taste at all. She was dressed in a black
and yellow changeable silk, and my mother was dressed in a green and
orange, with a wreath of red roses in her hair. My grandmother tried
to talk French, but she mispronounced every word. That evening, when
any one was introduced, she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
ask them if they could "<i>barley vouse frog's hay</i>,"&mdash;and at
supper, she said that she would take "<i>chockalat</i>," it was such
a "<i>soul stirring beverage</i>." She took ice cream, and said that
"she always took ice cream, <i>bekase</i> she thought it cooled her
<i>heterogeneous and amalgamated system</i>; besides, it was the merry month
of <i>Jew-win</i>." At home, when we had company, she always talked so. We
had some pretty high folks, for she had worked her way into the upper
ten. One evening Sir Thomas Fitz-Patrick came to see her. At tea, she
said, "Dear Sir, let me persuade you to take one <i>airy</i> mouthful of
'<i>fram boyses</i>,' or else do condescend to taste some '<i>frommage</i>;'
it is quite new, my Lord, and I hope it will please your '<i>diddle de
tory</i>,' taste." After tea, she said, "Oh! My Lord, don't you perfectly
adore Byron and Shakspeare? I think that one is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
'<i>cherubimical</i>,' and the other so '<i>seraphical</i>.' Don't you recollect
that passage from 'Macbeth,' in act second, and scene second, 'Hark,
who lies i' the second chamber;' and in Hamlet's '<i>solukey</i>' in scene
fifth, act first, 'Alas! poor ghost?'" My little mother used to prink
before the glass, and hold me up to see how handsome I was, till I was
very tired of looking at myself. My mother never let me do any sewing,
for fear I should spoil my fingers, and thus I passed a very idle life.
I could not read much, as my mother was afraid that I would hurt my
eyes. One day my mother said, that her grandmother was coming to live
with us, and also her aunt, who was not married. She said that she
hated old maids, though they had got to come; but she would not speak
to them. I was very sorry indeed to hear this.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="ph4">NUTTING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One day, before her grandmother and aunt came, my fine mother,
Garafelina, told me that she had been invited to a nutting, but as
a nutting was so low a pastime, she had half a mind not to go. Her
mother, however, told her, she would cut such a grand show, that she
had better go; so she had consented, and was going to take me with
her. The next morning my mother was up early, and awoke me, when the
following conversation was held:&mdash;"Josey, my dear, I think you had
better have on your silk dress, as I want you to make a grand show,"
said my mother. "But," said I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
"hadn't I better wear another, as I may spoil it?" "Why, child,
what can you be thinking of? don't you want to make a show?" "Yes,
mother, but I had rather take comfort than make a show?" "Stop, do as
I have bid you, and say no more about it." In the course of an hour my
mother and I had got dressed, and as we descended to the dining-room,
Garafelina's mother said to her, "My dear, the young misses and masters
have all been waiting here some time, and I told them that you were
not up yet, and so they waited." "Dear me! how sorry I am," said my
mother, in her most affected tone, "to have given these young ladies
and gentlemen the affliction of waiting for me." "Not at all," they
politely replied. We now started, and as we got out of the door, my
mother started back, and said, "Mercy on me! haven't you any carriage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
or barouche for us to ride in, I shall be so extremely and exceedingly
fatigued?" However, they had not, and so we started along; Garafelina
all the time lamenting that she had not got her "landau" with her, as
she would die very soon. In an hour or so we got to the woods, where we
sat down to rest ourselves. While thus resting, we heard a very loud
screaming; and turning in the direction of the cry, there we saw my
mother, Garafelina, screeching with all her might, "Oh save me, save
me!" she cried. All the boys and girls ran to her, and asked her what
was the matter. "Oh the spider, the spider!" she screamed, and upon
looking, they found a very small spider on her dress, and she, instead
of shaking it off, began to scream lustily. I thought my mother was
very foolish to make so much ado about a little spider, but I did not
tell her so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Garafelina being rid of the spider, began to gather the nuts, with
the rest of the party. But then she tore her dress on a bramble-bush,
and had her veil torn off by the boughs, which accidents made her so
ill-humored, that they all secretly agreed never to invite her again.
As they were going home, they saw a drove of cows before them, which
made my mother run and scream like a maniac. One of the little girls
said that they were her mother's cows, and that if they would come into
the cow-yard, they could see them milked. None of the party hesitated
but Garafelina, who said that she did not want to go into a dirty old
cow-yard. Soon, however, she changed her mind, and went. I had seen
cows milked at my mother's house, (I mean Agnes Earle's); but I enjoyed
the scene before me very much. First, half of the girls tried, and then
the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
half; and then half of the boys, and then the other half. When it came
Garafelina's turn, she went about it so awkwardly, that it made them
all laugh. She spattered a shower of milk over upon her dress; the
cow knocked her down; and when she got up, she was indeed a sight!
Her dress and veil were torn, and spattered with dirt, and her dress
was all covered with spots, where the milk had been spattered upon
her. When she got home, she complained of the ill treatment she had
received; and her mother said that she should never go again to a
nutting.</p>

<p>When I went to sleep that night, I prayed that I might be delivered
from such a mother, and be placed in the hands of a better one, who
had more sense, and who was not so ill-humored and proud. Early
next morning my mother told me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
sorrowfully, that her old aunt and grandmother were coming next week,
for which I was quite as sorry as my mother, for I thought that I had
enough of troubles.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="ph4">AN OLD MAID AND A GRANDMOTHER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In a week they arrived. The old maid was a quiddling thing, and the
grandmother was always saying that she could never get over a cold;
and then she would tell how she had got it. One day this aunt (her
name was Betsy Harper) said to my mother, "Do make your doll's hair
curl a little more to the front, and tie her shoe-string a little
longer; and there! do fix her apron-string, I hate to see it touch
the placket-hole." "Oh!" said her grandmother, "never mind, Betsy, if
you had such a cold as I have got; I never can get rid of it." "Do
stop," said Betsy. This aunt objected to my having my soup eaten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> so
quick; she always allowed herself five minutes to have it eaten, and no
more, nor less. Then I was to hold my spoon just so, and only to put
half a spoonful in at a time, for she had known little girls (and she
said, why not dolls as well as girls?) to be choked in taking a whole
spoonful at a time. Nor must I take a quarter of a spoonful, as I would
not have my soup eaten in five minutes. I am sorry to say that I often
wished that this aunt was in the Red Sea, and not very near dry land;
but I suppose that it was all meant for my good. One evening there
was company, and one lady took me up, and said, "This is a beautiful
doll." "But don't you think that she would be handsomer, if she had her
hair curled a little closer, and if one of her nostrils was a little
better shaped, and if one of her eyes was a little higher and blacker,"
said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Betsy Harper. "I don't know, I'm sure," said the lady. At this moment
Garafelina came up, and said, that if the lady would be pleased to
accept of the doll, and carry it home to her little girl, that she
would be very much obliged to her. The lady thanked Garafelina, and
said that Amelia would be very much pleased with me. I hoped that my
new mother would take good care of me, and love me very much. Whether
she did or not, you will hear in the next chapter.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="ph4">ACCIDENTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"Amelia see what I have brought you," said Mrs. Joyce to her little
girl.</p>

<p>"What is it mother?"</p>

<p>"A most beautiful little doll."</p>

<p>"Oh, goody! mother, how glad I am."</p>

<p>"Well, my little girl, I am glad to see that you like the doll; but
wait till morning, and then you can see her plainly."</p>

<p>The next day was occupied in admiring me. Her mother said,</p>

<p>"Amelia, now you must be very careful of this doll. Her name is
Josephine Arnoldson."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, mother, I shall be very careful of her indeed." But in a week
my little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
mother began to be rather careless of me; she left me all around the
house, and very often left me in the barn and wood-house all night.</p>

<p>One day, when, as usual, she had left me on the sofa, a fat old lady
came in and sat on me, and broke one of my arms. All the time that she
was sitting on me, she hurt me dreadfully, and I could not speak, she
suffocated me so. After she had gone, my mother found me, and said,
"Oh, oh, my dear child! how much you must have suffered, to have had
old Mrs. Jones sit on you, and I do declare if your arm is not broken!"
Her mother who stood by, said,</p>

<p>"Amelia, she would not have been broken if you had not left her about;
in future you must look out where you leave her; and to-night I will
get your father to mend her arm."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
My next accident was thus: Amelia's brother took me by the arm and
flung me round the room, and then suddenly let me drop, and cracked a
piece out of my head. I was taken to a shop where I had my head mended.
One can scarcely notice the mark, except a little very white spot,
whiter than the rest of my body. One day Amelia was washing me, and
she held me too near the fire to dry me, when my hair caught, and in
a moment was all in flames. I screamed with all my might, and so did
my mother; and her nursery-maid caught me up and soused me in a basin
of water. Such a fright as I was! my hair was all burned off. It was
some time before I got over my fright and pain. The next week I was
taken to the city, where a barberess made me another wig. One day a
large Newfoundland dog took me up in his mouth, and run away with me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
only in fun, but I was terribly frightened. In a day he brought me home
again, much to the relief of my mother and myself. My mother told me
that she had suffered very much for my absence, and she was going to
give me up for lost, (for one of her servants said that she had better
hunt for me, but after a while she said she couldn't,) when her maid
came running up with me, and said that she had just found me on the
front-door step. In a month I had my right leg broken very badly, but
after a while it got well again. My mother carried me out to walk, when
the same dog snatched me away, and took me to my present mother.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="ph4">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p>My new mother's name was Violet La Grange, and she was very much
pleased with me, and showed me all round the house. Every one else
seemed pleased with me too, especially Lily, her younger sister, who
patted the dog, and called him a "real good dog," and many other names.
The place where I now live is called "La Grange Place," and is a most
beautiful mansion-house, with parks, and everything else befitting such
a splendid place. My new mother made me dresses, and got me a little
house, in which I can live. I think I never shall have any other mamma,
for she told her little sister that she should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
have me when she is herself too old to play with me. I have formed an
acquaintance with another doll, who lives a little way from here. Her
name is "Maria Poppet," and her mother is Lucy Ashbourne, the most
intimate friend of my mother. For Maria I entertain a most lively
friendship, and when our mammas are playing round, we relate to each
other our adventures. Maria's adventures you may read in a volume
entitled "The London Doll."</p>

<p>I now close,&mdash;hoping that my readers will find as much pleasure in
reading my adventures as they have had in reading Maria's.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
